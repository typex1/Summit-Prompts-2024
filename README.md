Write a summary of a service review using two sentences.

Store: Online
Service: Shipping

Review: Amazon Prime Student is a great option for students looking to save money. Not paying for shipping is the biggest save in my opinion. As a working mom of three that is also a student, it saves me tons of time with free 2-day shipping, and I get things I need quickly and sometimes as early as the next day, while enjoying all the free streaming services and books that a regular Prime membership has to offer for half the price. Amazon Prime Student is only available for college students, and it offers so many things to help make college life easier. This is why Amazon Prime is the no-brainer that I use to order my school supplies, my clothes, and even to watch movies in between classes. I think Amazon Prime Student is a great investment for all college students.
